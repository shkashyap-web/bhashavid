> *“One who understands languages.”*

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Local markets (mandis) form the backbone of Bharat’s economy.  
However, vendors and buyers face persistent challenges:

- Language barriers between market participants  
- Lack of transparency in daily commodity prices  
- Unfair negotiations due to information asymmetry  
- Dependence on middlemen  
- Limited access to digital tools in regional languages  

These issues reduce income for small vendors and create inefficiencies in local trade.
